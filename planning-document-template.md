## My chosen poem

**Poem:** "The charge of the light brigade" by Alfred, Lord Tennyson

**Public domain verification:**
``` text
The author of this story died on October 6th, 1892.
```

**Why I chose this poem:**
``` text
I chose this poem due to my interest in stories about sacrifice, a brave army of soldiers going into battle not knowing whether or not they would come out of the conflict alive. The structure of the poem as well captured my interest, ending of each stanza with the outcome of the 600 soldiers. I also felt like it could be easy to illustrate what is happening in the poem as well.
```


**Brief description for design purposes:**
``` text
It feels very hopeful in the beginning, where a army of 600 soldiers ride into battle, but then turns gloomy when the battle turns in the favor of their enemy and are forced to retreat, losing many in the process, but then by the end it turns into honor, where they comemorate the fallen.
```


## HTML guidelines

Based on my AI conversations, here are my simple guidelines for structuring this poem:

**Document structure:**
- [ ] Main heading: Title and author of the poem.
- [ ] Poem container: Article will be used since it as a standalone work.
- [ ] Stanza handling: section will be used.
- [ ] Line breaks: br tags will be utilized to break the lines.
- [ ] Author attribution: Credit the author with name, date written, and link to website with the poem.

**Semantic elements to use:**
- [ ] Header: Title and author.
- [ ] Main: Article for the poem, section for each stanza and p with br for the lines.
- [ ] Footer: Date written.

**Accessibility considerations:**
- [ ] Heading hierarchy: H1 will be the title, and h2 will be the author.

## CSS guidelines

Based on my AI conversations, here are my simple design guidelines:

**Colors:**
- Background: Warm cream, #f4f1e9
- Text: Dark grey, #2b2b2b
- Accent color: none
- Why these colors: It's meant to give off a gritty kind of feel.

**Typography:**
- Heading font: MedievalSharp - Why: The poem references cannons, so I think its right to assume it takes place during medieval times, it feels right.
- Body/poem font: MedievelSharp - Why: I want to keep it consistent with everything in the website.
- Font sizes: Title will probably be around 20-24, author being around 18-20, and the poem itself will be around 14-18.

**Layout and spacing:**
- Content width: The poem is goin to be in the middle of the website with some stone artwork around the edges of the page.
- Stanza spacing: 1.6 line spacing.
- Overall feel: I want the feel to be gritty, as if your hearing a campfire story being told.

**Simple responsive plan:**
- Mobile: The poem will  will take up the whole screen to make reading it easy with the stone in the background.
- Desktop: The Poem will be in the middle, taking up around one third of the page, and stone will cover the empty space around the poem.

## Key AI conversations and discoveries

### What worked well
**Best prompt and response:**
``` text
"For my poem "The charge of the light brigade" which is about 600 soldiers nobly sacrificing themselves in battle, I need simple CSS guidelines. What colors would match the mood? What font pairings would work? How much spacing between stanzas? Give me practical starting points, not complex systems."
```

**Why this worked:**
``` text
It gave me a lot of good suggestions on how to theme my website for this poem. Some things I wanted to either add or change, like the font which was originally Merriweather, but I liked MedievalSharp better.
```

### What surprised you
**An AI limitation you discovered:**
``` text
I didn't really find any limitation, when I asked for some public domain poems, it gave me a couple of women poets, and when I asked for more women/non-western poets, it gave me some public domain poems written by women and non-western poets quickly. One things that did feel like it wasn't too good on was with colors for my website, it only showed me the code, and when I went to look up the color, it didn't feel like it matched what the theme should have been. It gave me pure white for the background and a dark red for the text color it didn't feel like it would be pleasant to read.
```

**How you worked around it:**
``` text
I asked for some warmer colors, I wanted it to still feeel gritty but also readible.
```
