# AI Collaboration Reflection

**Student Name:** William Harvey

## What worked well with AI

**Your most successful AI interaction:**

``` text
The one where I asked for better colors for the background and for the text, it gave me better colors than the original that it had suggested to me in the beginning.
```

**How your prompting improved:**

``` text
I was more direct with my prompts, and it gave me more of what I was asking for in the replies.
```

**AI's best contributions:**

``` text
It has been a great help with helping me understand what is needing to be done, and giving me great ideas as well with what I can do.
```

## Learning from limitations

**One thing AI got wrong or missed:**

``` text
It seemed to miss the mark with the kind of coloring that goes together with the background and text of the website. Sure, color is subjective, but with it recommending a near pure white background and dark red text it didn't really fit the theme and felt like it wouldv'e hurt to read.
```

**Your workaround strategy:**

``` text
I asked for a more interesting color, and for the text to be brighter.
```

**Advice for other students:**

``` text
Be more specific with some of the things you are looking for when asking AI about subjective changed, don't outright state what you think you want, because you could miss out on some great suggestions.
```

## Ready for implementation?

**Are you prepared to start coding your poetry website?** Yes

**Why or why not?**

``` text
I'm somewhat confident, I still need to get back into the grove of writting html and css again, since it's been a while since I last did it, but I feel like I can get it done.
```

**How will you use AI in the main Poetry project?**

``` text
I'll probably do the same thing, it worked out well for me this time, but I'll be more specific with what I want.
```

**Most important lesson learned:**

``` text
That AI is a very powerful and can give me suggestions that just sound right to me, I'm not a very picky person when it comes to the whole of the project, but I had somewhat of an idea of what I wanted to make, and chatgpt got me to the finish line.
```

**Public domain verification:**

``` text
The poem was written in 1854, way before the date of when certain works need to be looked into more if they are public domain or not.
```
